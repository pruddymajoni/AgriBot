#Problem Statement

Being one of the poorest nations in the world, climate change has caught Zimbabwe's heavily agriculture dependent economy off guard. Thousands of Zimbabweans planted crops they have normally cultivated in the last few decades. Lately, these crops are getting burned off by extreme heat with little to no rainfall. Zimbabweans need to adapt to climate change and desertification of some parts of the country so that we will not have more people dying of hunger. 

#Our Solution 
A Machine Learning system that tells farmers what to plant.

We created a Web Application to let the farmer enter details on their soil and weather. Our app gives the farmer a reccomendation based on their input.
